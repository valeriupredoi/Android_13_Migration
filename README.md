## Steps how to migrate from Android 10 to Android 13

- migration devices: Motorola G7 (android 10) to Motorola G73 (Android 13)
- needed: USB-C to USB-C cable

**Steps:**

- connect the two devices with said cable and let the wizard do its job; this will have transferred apps metadata from the old phone to the new one, keeping settings, contacts etc where applicable
- when all's migrated, apps will be downloaded from the AppStore (note that only the header files had been downloaded from the old phone, the apps, at current versions, will be downloaded from the AppStore);
- open each app and sign in/authenticate etc

**Issues:**

- NCAS Slack: launch app, authenticate with Google; the NCAS channel will not be accessible, and invoking "Sign In" may fail, in which case remove channel from list, and add back on - this will trigger opening Chrome correctly and login via NCAS Gmail will be possible;
- Facebook Messenger has lost Chat Heads, if one wants something a la Chat Heads, then one needs to enable Bubbles (first from the Messenger's Settings, then accept the new setting (Bubbles) activation in the main OS settings);
- Keyboard: BigButtons will not work anymore, GBoard is pretty much the only option - but, in my case, it's tiny; GBoard has a Resize option, via press-and-hold the blue Search key, but resizing works only to a small fraction; instead, follow these steps, to get into and display the actual menu of the screen keyboard:

1. Press and hold Comma button
2. Select Cog icon
3. From GBoard Settings, select Text Correction
4. Toggle the Show suggestion strip button to on
5. Select icon that looks like four squares above keyboard on left
6. Select button that reads Resize
7. Scale keyboard - scaling now to 20-30% bigger!
- right-hand side button (screen closing etc) doesn't act like a Power button anymore! For it to revert its action as power/screenshot button, go into Settings - Gestures - Press and hold power button, toggle off (FFS, Google!).
